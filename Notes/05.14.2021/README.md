# Known major performance issues:

Google no longer runs benchmarks their software (as of 2018) as they discontinued their last benchmarking tool (Google Octane) in 2018.

Performance of Google products has gone down significantly over the years due to poor programming.

> YouTube takes up a minimum of 95 MB of RAM on Firefox, even if a video isn't playing, then it takes up more. YouTube used to use less than 10 MB of RAM per tab. This isn't because it got more advanced, this is because it isn't being optimized anymore

## Google search isn't about speed anymore

> Google no longer cares about the speed of their search engine, which is one of the things that made them a tech monopoly in the first place. They care about how many ads they can force on you in the first 2 pages of results, and cater to their own preferences

## Bad URL handling

> Google Translate generates a URL of the entire translation on both ends every time you change a single letter. This can add a megabyte to your search history every minute (and can pile up to a gigabyte in just a few days)
 
## Android down-performance

Android 1.5 could run with less than 256 megabytes of RAM really fast, even with an animated wallpaper. Nowadays, Android 10 and up require over 2 gigabytes of RAM and does far less (the GUI does nothing to this, as Android 2.3 is like the Mona Lisa compared to Android 10 which is just the paint bucket in MS-PAINT, yet A10 uses up much more RAM)

Nothing is being optimized, it is getting clunkier, and more RAM is needed on phones to handle it.

## Ads drain CPU

On Ubuntu Linux with Firefox, sites that use Google ads will drop your framerate in half and start mining your CPU. This is why you should use an adblock. I only found out because I created a fresh profile, and visited a site before getting uBlock Origin installed.
